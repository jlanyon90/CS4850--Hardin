Trying to implement if statements through Flex/bison

command 'make y.tab.c' - produces y.tab files from a7bison.y
command 'make lex.yy.c' - produces lex.yy.c file from a7lex.l
command 'make executable' - produces ./a7_lanyon executable file use this to run

if statement does not fully work. However all other function work.
